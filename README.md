# ForecastFactory, AI-Driven Scenario Simulator

ForecastFactory is an advanced **AI-powered forecasting and simulation platform** built with **Python, Streamlit, Prophet, and SQLAlchemy**. It enables analysts, data scientists, and business strategists to **simulate business outcomes under different “what-if” scenarios**, allowing organizations not just to predict, but to *plan and adapt* intelligently.

---

## Project Overview

ForecastFactory bridges the gap between **data-driven forecasting** and **strategic scenario planning**. Traditional forecasting tools answer “what will happen,” while ForecastFactory explores **“what could happen”** under changing conditions like pricing shifts, ad budget changes, or supply constraints.

**Core Purpose:** Empower teams to **simulate future outcomes**, test assumptions, and quantify the effect of strategic decisions in real time.

---

## Business Goal

Most organizations rely on static forecasts that can’t adapt to real-world changes. ForecastFactory empowers them to:

* **Quantify trade-offs:** What if ad spend rises by 20%?
* **Stress-test assumptions:** How sensitive is revenue to a price increase?
* **Prepare for volatility:** What if demand drops due to supply shortages?

It transforms forecasting from passive prediction into **active decision simulation**.

---

## Key Features

* **AI Forecasting:** Prophet-based trend, holiday, and seasonality modeling.
* **Scenario Engine:** Interactive “what-if” analysis with domain-driven adjustments.
* **Elasticity Modeling:** Realistic impact simulation via custom elasticity coefficients.
* **SQL-Integrated Pipeline:** Seamlessly fetch data via SQLAlchemy.
* **Dynamic Visualization:** Real-time Plotly and Streamlit dashboards.
* **Explainability:** Automated narrative summaries for business interpretation.
* **Exportable Outputs:** Save data as CSV or Markdown reports.

### Design Philosophy

The system is **modular and extensible**, enabling analysts to plug in new models or connect it to MLOps pipelines for continuous retraining.

---

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Data & SQL Layer

* **SQLite** used for quick prototyping, extensible to PostgreSQL or Snowflake.
* **SQLAlchemy ORM** provides seamless connection and schema management.
* Data cleaned and aggregated via Pandas ETL transformations.

### 2. Forecast Engine

* Powered by **Prophet**, modeling seasonality, trend, and holiday effects.
* Fallback to **Moving Average** for baseline comparison.
* **Backtesting pipeline** validates performance via MAE, RMSE, and SMAPE.

### 3. Scenario Engine

* Defines relationships such as:

  * `ΔQ/Q = ε × ΔP/P` (Price elasticity)
  * `Uplift = α × log(1 + β × AdSpend)` (Media response)
  * `Q' = Q × (1 + γ × PromoFlag)` (Promotion effects)
* Produces **differential forecasts** showing net impact vs baseline.

### 4. Visualization Layer

* Streamlit powers the interactive UI.
* Plotly renders visual insights with interactivity and real-time updates.
* Exports available in CSV format for further analysis.

### 5. Explainability Module

* Integrates Prophet component decomposition and SHAP-like narratives.
* Generates business-oriented insights:
  *“Increased ad spend drove +7.8% uplift over baseline between July-August.”*

## Case Study, *E-commerce Demand Simulation*

**Objective:** Forecast 90 days of revenue while simulating increased ad spend and promotions.

1. **Baseline:** Prophet trained on 2 years of revenue data.
2. **Scenario:** +15% ad spend, 10% promotion activation.
3. **Elasticity Equations:**

   * Ad response = 0.3 × log(1 + 0.001 × spend)
   * Promo uplift = +6%
4. **Result:** +8.7% projected uplift vs baseline; ±2.3% confidence margin.
5. **Insight:** The simulator suggested that moderate ad increases yield diminishing returns after 15% budget growth.
